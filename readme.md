#### svomp – 1.0.3

Collection of frequently used **sv**elte-c**omp**onents  
**⚠️ heavily under construction at the moment**

It should be mentioned here that some components, namely "lazyload" and "prism", are coupled with my global styles lib [glocss](https://github.com/vedam/glocss) to keep stuff lean and lightweight. I don't know if this is best practise, but for me it makes most sense for now.

##### install

```bash
# install as devDependency
npm i -D @vedam/svomp
```
